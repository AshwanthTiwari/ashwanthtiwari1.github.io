My name is Ashwanth Tiwari, I am hands-on technical guy and flexible with learning new technologies and working with them.
I started in IT at an entry level position and later on moved into in systems administration and engineering.
I have worked many years on traditional datacenter tech stack such as VMware, Microsoft technologies (AD,DNS,DHCP,Exchange,SCOM,SCCM,AD Certificate services, DFS and others), Storage (IBM,HP, EMC, Dell, NetApp) and Backup technologies (Commvault, BackupExec, Veeam). More an IT generalist.

For last few years, I have been focussing on cloud computing. I have had the opportunity to work with AWS, Azure and GCP. I have developed more interest in Azure and it has been my current focus. I also worked in RPA space (robotic process automation) as a consultant in which I used to design and implement RPA on any platform (VMware, Hyper-V, Azure, AWS and GCP).
